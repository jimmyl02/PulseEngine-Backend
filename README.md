# ccdcscoring-backend
Backend server to support ccdcscoring

The backend server handles all updates to the scores, user creation, competition management, and all aspects related to the web application portion of the scoring model. Information about each route can be found in the file which handles that route.

This application was built using node.js, express, and typescript. Additionally, there must be a mongodb server to act as a database and manage all the data the application handles.
